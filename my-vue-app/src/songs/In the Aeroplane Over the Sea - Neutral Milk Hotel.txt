Let us lay in the su_n
And count every bea_utiful thing we can se_e.
Love to be_

_ What a curious li_fe
We have found here to_night
There is music that so_unds from the street
_ There are lights in the clo_uds
Anna's ghost all a_round
Hear her voice as it's roll_ing and ringing through _me
Soft a_nd sweet
How the no_tes all bend and re_ach above the_ trees

How stran_ge it is to be _anything at _all
