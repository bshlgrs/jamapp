When your _rooster crows at the _break of dawn

And it ain't_ no use in a-_turning on your _light, babe
The li_ght I never know_ed
And it ain't_ no use in _turning on your _light, babe
_ I'm on the dark side of the ro_ad
But I _wish there was something you would_ do or say
To _try and make me change my _mind and stay
But _we never _did too much _talking _anyway
But _don't think _twice, it's all right

So it ain't_ no use in _calling out my _name, gal
_  Like you never done be_fore
And it ain't_ no use in _calling out my _name, gal
_  I can't hear you any_more
I'm a-_thinking and a-wondering, _walking down the road
I _once loved a woman, a _child, I'm told
I _give her my _heart but she _wanted my so_ul
But _don't think _twice, it's all _right

So _lo_ng, honey _babe
Where I'm _bound, I can't_ tell
_Goodbye's _too good a _word, babe
_ So I'll just say, "Fare thee _well"
I _ain't a-saying you treated _me unkind
You _could've done better, but_ I don't mind
_You just kinda _wasted my _precious _time
But _don't think _twice, _it's all right
