And _now, the end is _near
Am/C B7
And so I _face the final _curtain
Em Em7
My fri_end, I'll say it _clear
A7 D
I'll state my ca_se, of which I'm _certain
D.. Dmaj7.. D7(9).. D7(b9)..
I've li_ved _ a life that's _full
G Gm
I traveled _each and every _highway
D A7
And _more, much more than _this
G D.. D/A..
I did it _my _way
#v
Re_grets, I've had a _few
But then a_gain, too few to _mention
I _did what I had to _do
And saw it _through without e_xemption
I plan_ned _each charted _course
Each careful _step along the _byway
And _more, much more than _this
G D.. A..
I did it _my _way

Yes, there were _times, _ I'm sure you _knew
G G7M
When I bit _off more than I could _chew
Em7 A7
But through it _all, when there was _doubt
F#m7 Bm7
I ate it _up and spit it _out
Em7 A7
I faced it _all, and I stood _tall
G D.. D/A..
And did it _my _way
#v
I've _loved, I've laughed and _cried
I've had my _fill, my share _of losing
And _now, as tears sub_side
I find it _all so amu_sing
To _think _ I did all that_ _
And may _I say, not in a _shy way
Oh, _no, oh, no, not _me
G D.. A..
I did it_ my _way

D.. D7M.. D7
For what is a _man, _what has he _got?
If not him_self, then he has _naught
To say the _things he truly _feels
And not the _words of one who _kneels
The record _shows I took the _blows
G D.. A..
And did it _my _way

_Yes, _it was _my _way
