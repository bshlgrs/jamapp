_When you were young, you were the _king of carrot _flowers_

_ In holy rattlesnakes that _fell all around your _feet

_ And your mom would stick a fork right _into daddy's _shoulder
F C.. Bb..
_ And dad would throw the garbage _all across the _floor_
C Bb F.. Bb. F. C.. Bb..
_ As we would lay and learn what _each other's bodies were _for

_ And this is the room one after_noon, I knew I could _love you
_ And from above you how I _sank into your _soul_
_ Into that secret place where _no one dares to _go

_ And your mom would drink until she was_ no longer _speaking_
_ And dad would dream of all the _different ways to _die_
_ Each one a little more than _he could dare to _try
